# ENS_DomainService Polygon Blockchain
We’re going to be making a smaller version of ENS on the Polygon blockchain: we’ll let anyone buy a domain NFT and point it to something. This is awesome cause once your contract is on the blockchain, any data it has will be universal! Anyone can read the names and look at what it’s pointing to. And because blockchains are so unstoppable, no one can remove your data or kill your epic domain.
